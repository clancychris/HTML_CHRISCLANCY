        <h2>About me</h2>
    </div>
    <h3>Name:</h3>
    <p>Chris Clancy</p>
    <h3>Bio:</h3>
    <p>I have spent most of my life as, first a musician, and then as a music producer at a professional level. I have achieved a great deal of success in this field including working with artists I listened to growing up and even being nominated for a JUNO Award (Canadian Grammy). I feel I've achieved everything I wanted to do in this field and it's time to move into something different. I have been teaching myself Python and learning more and more about roles and skills within the tech sector. I find coding fascinating and can't wait to learn more each day. I have always had an interest in tech and computer and I've been fortunate that my role as a producer enables me to work with computers and software on a daily basis.</p>

        <h3>3 episodes where I have faced issues and overcome them.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When I first did a job as a music producer, I was working alongside my all-time favourite producer who has done a lot of my favourite records. I had never recorded a drum kit, put microphones on a drum kit, and this was my first job working with another artist. I spent the days leading up to this educating myself from anywhere I could on the best ways to tackle these holes in my knowledge. When I arrived at the studio, I set everything up and the producer I mentioned praised me on my knowledge of drum tuning, microphone placement and how confident I was at it.</li>
            <li>In my last job role before I started my own business, I worked for an e-commerce company. They were 18 months behind in their listing across various platforms. Some items would be listed on eBay, some on Amazon, but everything was inconsistent. I spent a few day learning about csv files and bulk uploading/listing. Comparing data from eBay/Amazon I noticed there were a lot of similarities and it was mainly the column arrangement that differed. I spent a few weeks teaching myself how to write macros using Excel and a while later, I automated the entire process. New items could be listed on both platfroms using the macros I created, also listings could be ported from one platfrom to another. I also learned photoshop automation so the product photos would be automatically generated, put into folders with a naming scheme and uploaded along with the products. After 4 weeks I didn't have much of a job left to do, but I had caught up on 18 months of backlog. </li>
            <li>In my current role there is a lot of manual work which is very time consuming. Doing an album, if there are 12 tracks and I change a sound on one of them, it needs updating on the other 11. This can be an hour long job. I have used tools such as applescript and soundflow to automate many of the processes. I can now hit one button, walk away from the computer and come back an hour later to find the job completed. This helps me focus on the more creative aspects of my work and not get bogged down with some of the more tiresome work. I have actually grown to enjoy the automation process/scripting more than the work I am doing which is why I am going down this path.</li>

        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Problem solving is one of my strongest points, I love a challenge and work well in environments where problem solving is a key part of my role</li>
            <li>Communication skills have been crucial in my previous work, managing people in person/remotely and co-ordinating internationally to make sure projects come in ahead of deadlines, working around constantly changing variables.</li>
            <li>Self initiative is a strong point. I am self taught in almost everything I do and spend a lot of my free time educating myself and researching to overcome obstacles.</li>
            <li>â€‹Having been responsible for the production of music in a professional setting, including managing budgets and schedules I am good at keeping track of multiple things and sticking to deadlines.</li>

        <h3>Recent Projects:</h3>
        <p>Most recently I successfully coded the games Snake and then Pong in python using Turtle. I wanted to take things a step further with Pong and made a CPU player to play against. This was my first time using OOP and I found it absolutely fascinating. </p>
