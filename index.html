        I am a developer currently studying <em>Python</em>, <em>HTML</em>,
        <em>CSS</em>, <em>Javascript</em>, <em>Node</em>, <em>React</em>,
        <em>MonogoDB</em>, <em>Web3</em> and <em>DApps</em>

        I have spent most of my life as, first a musician, and then as a music
        producer at a professional level. I have achieved a great deal of
        success in this field including working with artists I listened to
        growing up and even being nominated for a <em>JUNO Award</em> (Canadian
        Grammy). I feel I've achieved everything I wanted to do in this field
        and it's time to move into something different. I have been teaching
        myself Python and learning more and more about roles and skills within
        the tech sector. I find coding fascinating and can't wait to learn more
        each day. I have always had an interest in tech and computer and I've
        been fortunate that my role as a producer enables me to work with
        computers and software on a daily basis.

          When I first did a job as a music producer, I was working alongside my
          all-time favourite producer who has done a lot of my favourite
          records. I had never recorded a drum kit, put microphones on a drum
          kit, and this was my first job working with another artist. I spent
          the days leading up to this educating myself from anywhere I could on
          the best ways to tackle these holes in my knowledge. When I arrived at
          the studio, I set everything up and the producer I mentioned praised
          me on my knowledge of drum tuning, microphone placement and how
          confident I was at it.

          I used to work for an e-commerce company. They were 18 months behind
          in their listing across various platforms. I spent a few days
          comparing csv files and bulk uploading/listing. It took me a few few
          weeks teaching myself how to write macros using Excel, but I automated
          the entire process. New items could be listed on both platforms using
          the macros I created, and could be ported from one platfrom to
          another. I learned photoshop automation so the product photos would be
          automatically generated, put into folders with a naming scheme and
          uploaded along with the products.

        <div class="box1 zoom2">
          In my current role there is a lot of manual work which is very time
          consuming. I have used tools such as applescript and soundflow to
          automate many of the processes. I can now hit one button, walk away
          from the computer and come back an hour later to find a job completed.
          This helps me focus on the more creative aspects of my work and not
          get bogged down with some of the more tiresome work. I have actually
          grown to enjoy the automation process/scripting more than the work I
          am doing which is why I am going down this path.

        Most recently I successfully coded the games Snake and then Pong in
        python using Turtle. I wanted to take things a step further with Pong
        and made a CPU player to play against. This was my first time using OOP
        and I found it absolutely fascinating.
